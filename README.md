This is a basic NodeJs application to handle event ticketing.

It is based on the js example assessment provided by 3D repo, but written in Typescript as that is how I have done all of my NodeJs development.

Instead of using express.js I have used Fastify - This is because when looking at FastApi for Python recently I looked into NodeJs equivalents and wanted to try Fastify as its meants to be faster than express.js.

I have still used jest tests and MongoDb as the example uses. I've used Mongoose to work with MongoDb to provide some structure.
